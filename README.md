# Guangzhou Air Quality Analysis (2020â€“2024)

## Overview

This project presents a data visualization and exploratory analysis of PM2.5 air quality trends in Guangzhou from 2020 to 2024. The purpose is to understand how fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels have evolved over recent years and to identify patterns or anomalies that may reflect policy changes, seasonal effects, or other influencing factors.


## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the original PM2.5 dataset (`.csv`)
- `figures/`: Contains generated charts and figures
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebook analysis
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python libraries

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights

- The PM2.5 level shows a seasonal fluctuation pattern with higher values typically in winter.
- The average PM2.5 levels have shown a general decline from 2020 to 2024, indicating improvements in air quality.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the analysis notebook in Jupyter
